Changing platforms has been the bane of my life. Moving my documents to an open format and to a technology that I can sync and save seems to be a good idea.</p> <p>After two years of experimentation with my own accounts, this is a new dedicated teaching account as of mid-2025.</p> <p>Retirement is hopefully not too far away! I want the notes in this repo to be available to my students after I retire, this is one way to do so.</p> <p>Contact me via my University e-mail address or via my LinkedIn account.</p>"}]}
